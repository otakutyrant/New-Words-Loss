# Requirements

* numpy
* stanza (optional, generate lemmas better than the traditional way)

# Features

All for One: Iterate all selected books and generate a whole file that counts and sort new words. Then you can memorize them effectively.

# TODO

* Explain new word loss here.
* ~~Use an AI lemmatizer to handle lemmas.~~
* Use job manager. https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=4326379
* Use progression bar like count_pages.
* ~~Show new words count and top five items.~~
* ~~Fix config widget size. https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=354124~~
* Use calibre.ptempfile instead of txt format so the later is not necessary any more.
