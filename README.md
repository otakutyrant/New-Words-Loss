* ~~Use an AI lemmatizer to handle lemmas.~~
* ~~Use job manager.~~
* Use progression bar like count_pages.
* ~~Show new words count and top five items.~~

* Use tmp files when txt format unavailable.
* Use gui2.warning_dialog to complement existing logging.warning
* Use gui.proceed_question, like action.py:275 in count_pages
